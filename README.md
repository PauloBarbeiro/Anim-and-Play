# Anim-and-Play
A simple game/application to teach children (5-10) animation principles.

The application uses imagens captured via webcam to create animated characters (little monsters :) ).
The player must draw, on paper, some imaginary creature, in diferent positions, and using this app, capture the sequences. 
After that, the creature starts to move arround the screen, and the goal is to use body movement to slap them. 

The tool meant to support educators in the process to teach animation for their students. Many children can draw diferent creatures,
and, with a projection, many children can play as well.
